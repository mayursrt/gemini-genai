budget 2024

There were two clear expectations for the economy from the first budget of the NDA government’s third term, which was presented on July 23: First, a roadmap on fiscal consolidation and second, a roadmap for medium-term interventions, in terms of the challenges facing the economy. The budget speech paid attention to both of these fronts.

The Finance Minister needs to be commended for sticking to the path of fiscal consolidation with a further reduction in the fiscal deficit target, compared to the interim budget. The estimated fiscal deficit for 2024-25 is 4.9 per cent of the GDP, bringing it closer to the target of 4.5 per cent in the next fiscal. Debt to GDP for the central government too has been forecast to reduce from 58.2 per cent to 56.8 per cent. While the budget speech does not provide a clear roadmap beyond 2025-26 in terms of target fiscal deficit, it does propose “to keep the fiscal deficit each year such that the central government debt will be on a declining path as percentage of GDP.” The flexibility provided by the lack of firm announcements would allow for nimble policymaking but limits predictability for the wider economy.

While fiscal consolidation is one primary concern of the government, augmenting expenditures is often seen as the other priority. In the last three years, additional fiscal space, made available through more buoyant tax revenues, has been utilised to raise the allocations for various spending programmes. Unlike in previous years, some of the additional resources available have been used for fiscal consolidation as well — the resources to undertake fiscal consolidation in this budget can be traced to the surplus to be received from the Reserve Bank of India. Some additions to expenditure and marginal compression in tax revenues too are observed when compared to the interim budget.

Working on the challenges flagged by the Economic Survey 2023-24, the budget speech presents an overview of the initiatives proposed for the current year as well as the next five years. Concerns regarding employability and employment for the youth and improved infrastructure in the country emerge as key points for motivating policy initiatives. A number of initiatives are proposed to create better employability through skilling and higher employment through financial support for provident fund contributions. While these initiatives are welcome and flag the concerns of citizens and the government, an overall framework would help identify the synergies among potential initiatives. The government’s proposal to present an economic policy framework is a welcome announcement in this regard — it can help establish consistent medium-term expectations on likely reforms to be undertaken.

On the tax front, the budget communicates a season of changes. Within indirect taxes, it signals the possibility of rationalisation of the GST rates and expansion in the base and continued recalibration of customs duties. Apart from the initial years which witnessed a slew of rate changes, the GST regime has been remarkably stable in terms of structure and design of the tax. However, some rationalisation of the structure is called for. The likely changes in the GST regime are widely anticipated and discussed, and would constitute an important step in completing the reform of the regime before it can settle into a stable and predictable regime for taxpayers as well as governments.

Festive offer
Unlike the GST regime, the customs duty regime is now used to address varying concerns in the economy — to reduce competition in some cases and to increase competition in others. The need for regular recalibration in customs duties too could benefit from an overall framework. The proposed economic policy framework could provide a basis for this, suggesting stability and predictability in the regime.

The medium-term approach is evident in the section pertaining to direct taxes as well: It begins with a proposal to undertake a review of the Income Tax Act with the objective to “make the Act concise, lucid, easy to read and understand”. A recurring theme in this section is the intent to reduce disputes and litigation. The budget proposes to introduce a “Vivad se Vishwas, 2024” scheme to reduce the amount of revenue locked in litigation. Manpower allocated to address the backlog of cases of first appeals too is proposed to be augmented. Further, the budget proposes to limit the cases of appeal by the departments in case of income tax, excise and service tax cases — cases involving small liabilities are not to be contested. The focus on dispute resolution is commendable; the source of large numbers of disputes too perhaps could use some attention.

Emerging discussions on direct taxes across the globe flag concerns of increasing inequality and the need to bring in higher levels of tax on “the rich”. The Economic Survey articulates the concern in terms of differential taxation of labour income and capital income. The budget seeks to address this concern by raising the taxes on capital gains, both short-term and long-term, while providing some relief to retail investors by raising the exemption to Rs 1.25 lakh. This initiative, along with the enhanced securities transaction tax on futures and options transactions, could cool some of the fervour in the capital markets in the short term and reduce some of the irrational exuberance, bringing in stability for the medium term.


How middle class pays more taxes than corporates, and gets ignored too
Individual taxpayers are paying more in taxes than corporates after taxes for companies were lowered in 2019. Experts say it is untenable in the long term that a middle-income country like India is funded by personal tax. Budget 2024 had a small relief for the salaried middle class as standard deduction. This is how just 2% of the population pays taxes for both earning and spending, and mostly gets ignored.

The middle class, the tax-paying population of India, stares at the face of the government every time the Budget day approaches. It is that neglected segment that pays both income tax for earnings, and GST for spending. It is this 2% of the entire population of India that is contributing massively to the country's infrastructure growth and welfare politics.

Just 2.24 crore Indians or 1.6% of the population paid tax, including income tax and corporate tax, in 2022-23, according to data shared by the government in 2023.

India has seen a rise in direct taxes, which has two components -- taxes on income (income tax) and corporate tax. In a good sign, direct tax receipts are more than indirect taxes now.

Here's where the story takes an unlikely turn. In direct taxes, it is the individual income tax that has overtaken corporate taxes in 2022-2023. People, mostly from the middle class, are contributing more in taxes than corporates.

"A middle-income country like India can't be funded by personal tax," political analyst Amitabh Tiwari, a former investment banker, tells IndiaToday.In.

Income tax is more than corporate tax in countries like the US where the tax base is wider. In the US, 43% of the population pays taxes against the 2% in India.

Budget 2024 had a small relief for the salaried middle class as the standard deduction in the new tax regime was raised from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. This, according to calculations, will leave around Rs 17,500 more in the hands of the common people.

PROFITS FOR CORPORATES UP, BUT TAXES DOWN?
The rise in income tax receipts surpassing the corporate taxes comes even as the markets have been booming with the benchmark BSE Sensex rising from around 19,000 in 2012 to 80,000 in 2024.

"In the last 12 years, stock markets have quadrupled, indicating that profits have gone up. But corporate taxes have gone down as a percentage of total receipts," says Tiwari.

"Tax on income, which is paid by 2% of India's population, is more than corporate tax. This isn't tenable in the long term," says Tiwari.

"The government reduced corporate tax in 2019, incurring a loss of Rs 1.44 lakh crore a year. The Economic Survey data shows that between FY20 to FY23, corporate profits have quadrupled. Which again shows that the corporate sector is performing, but paying less taxes due to tax cuts," says Tiwari.

The taxes were reduced to boost capital expenditure (capex), create private sector jobs and increase exports. The government's gamble was that the tax break would boost income and earn it taxes. But that hasn't been the case.

The Economic Survey 2023-24, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday, pointed this out in no flattering terms.

"Results of a sample of over 33,000 companies show that, in the three years between FY20 and FY23, the profit before taxes of the Indian corporate sector nearly quadrupled. Hiring and compensation growth hardly kept up with it," says the Economic Survey.

“That is why it is in the enlightened self-interest of the Indian corporate sector, swimming in excess profits, to take its responsibility to create jobs seriously,” it adds in a stark message.

WHY NOT GET MORE CORPORATES TO PAY TAX?
If the ratio of taxpayers to the population is skewed among the general public, it is no better among corporates.

As of October 2022, there were around 15 lakh private companies in India.

"Around 10.7 lakh companies filed income tax returns for Assessment Year 2023-24, with 5.1 lakh filing zero-tax returns and only 5.6 lakh paid taxes," says Amitabh Tiwari.

"Only 5% of companies pay 97% of the total corporate taxes. Among them, the top 150-odd companies pay 40% of the taxes," says Tiwari.

"The disparity is as high as with individual taxpayers, but never discussed," he adds.

There could be only two conclusions from the dismal tax payments by corporates in India. They are filing zero-returns either because of the significant deductions allowed, or because there is stress on the corporate sector, especially MSMEs.

The government has widened the tax net and more individuals are filing tax returns. The tax to GDP ratio of the country has also improved.

Out of the 7.4 crore Indians who filed tax returns in 2022-23, about 5.16 crore people, or 70%, had zero tax liability, according to data shared by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament in 2023. It is just 1.6% of the population that is over-taxed.

"The question before the government is how to increase tax collections from corporates. Also, how do you leave more money in the hands of individuals so that it boosts consumption," says Amitabh Tiwari.

He suggests that standard deduction for individuals or income exemption limit has to be increased for that.

That is what Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman seems to have attempted in her seventh Union Budget.

The standard deduction was increased by Rs 25,000 to Rs 75,000 in Budget 2024.

"The Standard Deduction limit has been hiked to Rs 75,000 to bring some sort of parity with corporates, which will leave an additional Rs 7,500 (at the highest tax bracket of 30%) in the hands of salaried taxpayers under the new tax regime," says Tiwari, reacting to the changes in Budget 2024.

Sitharaman also tweaked three tax slabs in the new tax regime.

"Tax slabs have also been tweaked at income levels lower than Rs 15 lakh, which will boost flagging consumption," says Tiwari.

For taxpayers in the highest (30%) tax bracket, with a taxable income of Rs 15 lakh or higher, the increased standard deduction limit will result in a saving of Rs 7,500. The rationalisation of tax rates will lead to a savings of Rs 10,000, bringing the total savings for this group to Rs 17,500.

The government said this will benefit four crore salaried individuals and pensioners. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Budget 2024 was for the empowerment of the new middle class.

HOW THE MIDDLE CLASS IS THE BEAST OF BURDEN
When it comes to taxing the expenditure of the middle class, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) plays a key role. There's respite for corporates, but not for individuals.

"Salaried individuals get no refund on GST paid, but corporates get input tax credit," says Amitabh Tiwari.

"While individuals are taxed on income, corporates are taxed on profits after deducting expenses from income. Standard deduction was introduced to bring some sort of parity but needs to be increased," says Amitabh Tiwari, explaining why the individual taxpayer is at a disadvantage.

While corporates got tax incentives in the 2019-20 Budget, individual taxpayers last saw a change in 2012-13. That's over a decade ago.

Despite the contribution towards public infrastructure and services by the middle class, which is around 31% of India's population, it has to be reliant on private schools and hospitals. Then there is the highway toll.

The highest 30% tax bracket for salaried individuals also kicks in at much lower incomes when compared to countries like Russia, China and the US.

It is also the people who pay the most taxes that have no social security and pension support.

While the government probably has its own reasoning for taking this path, experts point to the discrepancy in the percentage of people and corporates who end up being taxed. That is why in every Budget, the middle class looks up to the government with hope for some little tax relief.
