There were two clear expectations for the economy from the first budget of the NDA government's third term, presented on July 23:

1. A roadmap on fiscal consolidation.
2. A roadmap for medium-term interventions, in terms of challenges facing the economy.

**Fiscal Consolidation and Economic Framework**

The Finance Minister has stuck to the path of fiscal consolidation with a further reduction in the fiscal deficit target compared to the interim budget. The estimated fiscal deficit for 2024-25 is 4.9% of GDP, bringing it closer to the target of 4.5% in the next fiscal. Debt to GDP for the central government is forecast to reduce from 58.2% to 56.8%.

While the budget speech does not provide a clear roadmap beyond 2025-26, it proposes "to keep the fiscal deficit each year such that the central government debt will be on a declining path as a percentage of GDP." The flexibility provided by the lack of firm announcements allows for nimble policymaking but limits predictability for the wider economy.

**Employment and Infrastructure**

The budget outlines initiatives to create better employability through skilling and higher employment through financial support for provident fund contributions. The government also proposes an economic policy framework to establish medium-term expectations on reforms.

**Taxation**

The budget signals the possibility of rationalizing GST rates and expanding the base, along with continued recalibration of customs duties. A "Vivad se Vishwas, 2024" scheme is proposed to reduce revenue locked in litigation. The budget focuses on dispute resolution and intends to reduce the number of appeals by the departments in cases of income tax, excise, and service tax cases.

**Income Inequality**

The budget addresses concerns of increasing inequality by raising taxes on capital gains while providing some relief to retail investors. Enhanced securities transaction tax on futures and options transactions could reduce some of the exuberance in capital markets.

**Middle Class and Taxation**

Individual taxpayers are paying more in taxes than corporates, even though middle-class income contributes more than corporates. Budget 2024 provides a small relief to the middle class by raising the standard deduction. However, concerns about the tax burden on the middle class, including GST paid on their expenditures, remain.
