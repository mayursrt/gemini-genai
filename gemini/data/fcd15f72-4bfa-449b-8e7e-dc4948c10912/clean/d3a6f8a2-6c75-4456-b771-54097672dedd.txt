Auto-processing Approach to Current Supplier Files Processing Bots

Problem Statement:

The current mechanism for picking up supplier files is database-based. Only suppliers set up in the system are processed by the bot, which means new suppliers are missed for processing as they are added. Also, with new source entities being added to current suppliers and new acquisitions, it is imperative to implement a mechanism in the bot to auto-set up suppliers.

Solution:

1. As files are discovered through the email bot, the following scenarios need to be handled:

   a. The contract number on the file exists in the database, and processing is completed as per current modules defined in the system.
   b. The contract number does not exist in the database configuration, but the folder is set up for the supplier in the database, indicating other files or source entities have been configured for this supplier. In this case, the bot creates the source entity folder if it does not exist and saves the corresponding file in the folder. The bot also makes the corresponding entries in the database tables.
   c. The contract number does not exist and there is no supplier set up in the RPA configuration for the supplier. The bot runs an AI function to map the existing folder to the supplier name. If the folder is located, the bot creates the source entity folder if not already present and saves the file.

2. Instead of looping through the database entries in the setup tables, the bot recursively goes through the supplier folders to locate the files ready for processing. This approach ensures that the bot does not miss any files that are not set up in the system and facilitates processing files under new source entities that are not yet set up in the system. In this scenario, the bot creates the database setup entries when the new files are discovered and not set up. If the files are in an incorrect folder, the bot moves them to the correct folder.
